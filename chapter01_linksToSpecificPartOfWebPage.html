		<h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
		<p>Creating a paragraph for section 1 of this page. In the previous html code, a <b>break</b> was added to make sure that each links's text appears on a separate line. I suppose that if creating an unordered list, one would simply add the list code and omit the brea</p>
		<h2 id="section2">Section 2</h2>
		<p>Suppose you have a long story to tell. If this was the csae, your users would have to scroll down to the bottor and instead of having them scroll back up manually, you can have them clikc on a "Top" link that will take them back to whatever header is id-ed "Top"</p>
		<p>You will have multiple paragraphs.</p>
		<h2 id="section3">Section 3</h2>
		<p>You may also be just testing like I am and will see that it is a bit hard to come up with more interesting things to say. However, you can take the time to explan some of the thing you are learning. For instancem the that some tags can have <b>attributes</b> and that in this case, using the <b>id</b> attribute helps the browser identify different sections in a web page. Hence, you can use these <i>attibute</i> values to link to differen sections in the web page. I always wanted to know how this was done.</p>
