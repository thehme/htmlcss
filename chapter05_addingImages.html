		<p>When adding an image use the <b>img</b> <i>empty tag</i> and pass to it the attribute <b>src</b> with the path to the image. In my case, I saved the image in a folder within my webpage project that I called "images", so I am using a relative path to add the image in <b>src</b>. You can also add a <b>title</b> attribute with a title of the image, which is not displayed and/or the <b>atl</b> attribute, which can be used to describe the image. The <i>title</i> and <i>atl</i> tags seem to provide important imformation used by screen readers, which would describe a web page with visual disabilities. How cool is this?! I didn't even know this excited.</p>
		<img src="images/parikitty.jpg" alt="This is a picture of a cat who was dressed up in a stripped shirt with a kitty size boina hat. The picture was taken while the cat was sitting in someones leg, so you can only see his face and front paws. Personally, I think the kitty looks a bit french and since the picture is in black and white, it really adds that sort of Paris touch." title="Frech Kitty">
