		<h1>Multiple Selector Form</h1>
		<p>Suppose you want to allow the users to make multiple selections on a form. In order to do this, you can create a <b>&lt;form&gt;</b> element using the <b>&lt;select&gt;</b> element. The <b>&lt;select&gt;</b> element should be given a name via it's <b>name</b> attibute, which will be used to keep track of the option/s the user will select. If you want to let the user see more than one option from the list of options, the <b>size</b> attribute can be adjusted. If you want the user to be able to select more than one option, you can do this by setting the <b>&lt;select&gt;</b>'s <b>multiple</b> attribute to "multiple".</p>
		<p>For each option the user has available, you should create a new <b>&lt;option&gt;</b> element and assign a value to its <b>value</b> attribute. If you want any of these options to be pre-selected when the user loads the page, set its <b>selected</b> attribute to "selected". The option the user will see in the browser corresponds to the text you place between each option's opening and closing tags.</p>
