		<p>In conjunctions with the <b>&lt;form&gt;</b> tag, the <b>&lt;texarea&gt;</b> can be used to create a text area for users to enter text. There are the <b>cols</b> and <b>rows</b> attributes that can be used to re-size the text area, but CSS is prefered for controlling the hight and width of the text area box.</p>
		<p>An interesting aspect of the <b>&lt;texarea&gt;</b> element is that unlike the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> element, which is an empty element and doesn't need the closing tag, the <b>&lt;texarea&gt;</b> element does need a closing tag.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the <b>&lt;texarea&gt;</b> element takes in the <b>name</b>, <b>cols</b>, and <b>rows</b> attributes, but like with the <b>&lt;input&gt;</b> element, CSS is prefered for styling.</p>
